Local Admin - Powershell Scripts

This was originally written for a senario with hybrid identity and endpoints.
The challenge was allowing developers admin access to their laptops, but in a way that could be centrally managed and audited.

A combination of GPO and AD Groups, together with some info about device owner - provided the answer.
